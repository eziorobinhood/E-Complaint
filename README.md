# EComplaint

##Description:
This project develops a mobile application using Flutter and a backend system with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB to create an efficient e-complaint system for citizens. The app allows citizens to easily submit complaints regarding various issues such as:
 * Public infrastructure: Road damage, street lighting, sanitation
 * Public services: Water supply, electricity, transportation
 * Law and order: Noise pollution, traffic violations, anti-social behavior
Key Features:
 * User-friendly interface: Intuitive design for easy complaint submission and tracking.
 * Complaint categories: Categorize complaints for efficient routing and resolution.
 * Image/Video upload: Allow citizens to attach evidence (photos/videos) to their complaints.
 * Location tracking: Automatically capture the location of the complaint for better understanding and dispatch.
 * Complaint tracking: Track the status of submitted complaints in real-time.
 * Notifications: Receive notifications on complaint status updates.
 * Admin panel: (Optional) For administrators to manage complaints, view statistics, and assign tasks to relevant departments.
Technology Stack:
 * Frontend: Flutter (for cross-platform mobile app development)
 * Backend:
   * Node.js (for server-side scripting)
   * Express.js (for building RESTful APIs)
   * MongoDB (for storing and managing complaint data)
 * Other:
   * Cloud services (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud) for hosting and scaling the application.
   * Map integration (e.g., Google Maps, Mapbox) for location-based services.
